## WALS Analysis Project 
The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS, http://wals.info) is a
large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical)
properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as
reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors.  This repo holds some
python 3 code for statistical analysis of the WALS data  

--------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Dependencies: python 3,yaml,pandas,numpy,scipy,sklearn,jupyter/ipython,hashlib,pickle,fbpca,optparse.. heck I don't know, the interperter will tell you
  * WALS feature values:  http://wals.info/static/download/wals-language.csv.zip (before the yuck decision to include data in the repo)

  * Also, locator.py assumes the file progress.py is importable, so save progress.py someplace listed in the PATH variable e.g (/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages), or modify locator.py as you see fit.
