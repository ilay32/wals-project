## WALS Analysis Project ##
The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS, http://wals.info) is a
large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical)
properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials
(such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors. 
This repo holds some python 3 code for statistical 
analysis of the WALS data
